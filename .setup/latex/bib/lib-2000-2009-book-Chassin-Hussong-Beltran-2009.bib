  abstract = {This chapter will describe the prevalence and predictors of adolescent substance use and substance use problems, with particular emphasis on their relation to the developmental issues of adolescence. Given the wide scope of this field, we do not attempt a comprehensive review. For example, we do not consider issues of substance abuse treatment (see, e.g., Brown \& D'Amico, 2003; Morral, McCaffrey, Ridgeway, Mukherji, \& Beighley, 2006; Waldron \& Kaminer, 2004; Rowe & Liddle, 2006) or prevention (Caulkins, Liccardo, Pacula, Paddock, \& Chiesa, 2002; Faggiano et al., 2005; Gates, McCambridge, Smith, \& Foxcroft, 2006). Rather, we will selectively emphasize recent empirical work, as well as studies that illustrate important general themes in adolescent substance use research. },
